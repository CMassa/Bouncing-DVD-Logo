# Bouncing DVD Logo

Remembering DVD bouncing logo. It has been coded in C++ as a practice for applying some starter OpenGL concepts learnt from "Learn OpenGL - Graphics Programming" book from Joey de Vries.

## Requirements
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) >= 3.28.1
- [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/en/getting-started)

## Run program
I recommend using VSCode integrated with cmake and vcpkg. Once it is set up running `vcpkg install` should install all other needed dependencies `glfw3 / glad / stb / glm` depending your OS.
Executing `CMake: Build` on VSCode should be generating executable file under `build` folder.
